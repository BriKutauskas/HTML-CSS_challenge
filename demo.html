          Hi! I was born in Oregon and moved to East LA for college.  Then, I lived in LA for a couple of years before moving to San Diego.  Now I'm learning to code!

        <p>
          I love to practice yoga and dance.  I have been a dancer all my life and discovered that I really like yoga about 5 years ago.  My favorite type of yoga is Ashtanga yoga.

        <p>
          I was born in New York and moved to Denver when I was 7. I just moved to San Diego in January. I am also learning to code!
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy running, hiking, skiing, and strength training. I consider myself a morning person, so most mornings you can find me in the gym.
